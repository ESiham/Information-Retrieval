weaker tropical cyclones can still cause widespread damage both tropical storms allison in 2001 and lee in 2011 have caused over a billion in damage the former of which accounted for a higher damage total due to their excessive damage the names of tropical cyclones accruing at least 1 billion in damage are often retired by the world meteorological organization however this is not always the case

past this makes it hard to accurately compare the damage inflicted by hurricanes across time hurricanes harvey irma and maria are not included in this list yet as final damage costs are not determined yet preliminary total and non-official estimate costs for harvey range from 70 2 to 190 billion 3 thus unofficially making it either the third most expensive hurricane surpassing ike or the most
