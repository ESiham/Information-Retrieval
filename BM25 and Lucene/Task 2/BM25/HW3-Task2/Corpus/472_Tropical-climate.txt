diffuse a tropical climate in the köppen climate classification is a non-arid climate in which all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18 °c 64 °f in tropical climates there are often only two seasons a wet season and a dry season tropical climates are frost-free and changes in the solar angle are small in tropical climates temperature remains relatively constant hot throughout the year subtypes edit within the tropical climate zone there are distinct varieties based on precipitation tropical rainforest climate edit in the tropical rainforest climate af 1 all twelve months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm 2.4 in these climates usually occur within 5–10° latitude of the equator in some eastern coast areas they may extend to as much as over 26° away from the equator this climate is dominated by the doldrums low pressure system all year round and therefore has no natural seasons examples apia samoa af davao philippines af hilo hawaii united states af

in south and southeast asia and in south and central america as well as part of africa and australia it is dominated by the monsoon winds which change direction according to the seasons this climate has a driest month which nearly always occurs at or soon after the winter solstice for that side of the equator with rainfall less than 60 millimetres 2.4 in but more than 100 − total annual

climate such as some desert areas and alpine regions examples southern part of arabian peninsula the sahara desert alpine regions of the tropics mountaintops within the tropics e.g mount kenya can be cold however like lowlands in the tropics and unlike cold winter temperate zone regions there is little seasonal variation of temperature intertropical convergence zone edit because of the effect of sun angle on climate most areas within the tropics are hot year-round with diurnal variations in temperature exceeding seasonal variations seasonal variations in tropical climate are dominated by changes in precipitation which are in turn largely influenced by the tropical rain belt or intertropical convergence zone itcz a portion of the hadley cell the itcz is shown for july average in the graphic areas of ascending air have heavy rainfall areas of descending air are dry the itcz somewhat follows the solar equator throughout the year but with geographical variations and in some areas india is heavily influenced by local large-scale monsoons
