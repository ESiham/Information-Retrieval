The Formula for BM25 requires, frequency of a word in the document and thus an inverted list is required.

I have implemented the BM25 such that it first performs creating inverted index first from the Corpus available in
"HW3-Task2/Corpus" folder.

After the inverted index is created in the run, the BM25 goes ahead calculating the score for each document and ranking
them.

When the program is run, the following happens:

1. The corpus is processed to create inverted index for unigram
2. The query is read line by line from "QueryList.txt" file, where each query is split by a new line
3. The query is split into words and these words are matched with the terms from inverted index, to create a new reduced
   inverted index which contains only these terms
4. The document length of each length is calculated.
5. The Average document length of the Corpus is calculated as soon as the inverted index is generated from the corpus
6. The score of each document is caclulated and updated with already existing score of the document if it exists
7. For each query, the documents are ranked in descending order of their scores and the top 100 are results are recorded
   in files inside the folder "BM25 Scores"
8. The files are created such that for Query 1, a file called "Q1.txt" is created with top 100 results for that query.
   This process continues for all the queries.
   The format is:
   query_id	Q0	doc_id	rank BM25_score	BM25
   Ex: 1	Q0	3_Hurricane-Isabel.txt	1	6.83333212109	BM25 , this represents BM25 score for query 1
