season hurricane felix was the southernmost landfalling category 5 hurricane in the atlantic surpassing hurricane edith of 1971 it was also the most recent atlantic hurricane to make landfall as a category 5 until hurricane irma in 2017 1 2 it was the sixth named storm second hurricane and second category 5 hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season felix formed from a tropical wave on august 31 passing through the southern windward islands on september 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status a day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane and early on september 3 it was upgraded to category 5 status by 2100 utc the hurricane was downgraded to category 4 status but was upgraded to a category 5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of september 4 on september 4 felix made landfall just south of the border between nicaragua and honduras in the mosquito coast region as a category 5 hurricane with 160 mph 260 km h winds hurricane felix struck nicaragua on the same day as hurricane henriette struck the baja california peninsula in the eastern pacific ocean which marked the second recorded occurrence that a north atlantic hurricane and a pacific hurricane made landfall on the same day 3 the previous occurrence was on august 23 1992 when hurricane andrew hit the bahamas on the same day hurricane lester hit mexico s baja california peninsula at least 133 deaths are attributed to felix meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on august 24 tracking westward at approximately 14 mph 23 km h with no associated deep convection and a weak low-level inverted-v curvature 4 5 initially difficult to locate on satellites 6 the wave axis tracked through a moist environment 7 and developed an area of scattered thunderstorms by august 25 visible satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning just north of the intertropical convergence zone 8 the wave continued to develop moderate to strong convection and on august 27 a 1012 mbar hpa 29.88 inhg low pressure area developed about 830 mi 1,340 km west-southwest of praia cape verde 9 for the next several days the system failed to organize significantly 10 however on august 30 the wave became better defined with more representation of the cyclonic turning into the low 11 convection increased early the next day 12 and a hurricane hunters flight into the system reported the presence of a closed low-level circulation accordingly the national hurricane center initiated advisories on tropical depression six at 2100 utc on august 31 while it was located about 180 mi 295 km east-southeast of the southern windward islands 13 upon becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was located to the south of a strong ridge resulting in a west-northwest motion the system maintained curved rainbands with expanding outflow and with light wind shear and warm water temperatures the environment favored further development 13 its deep convection consolidated very near the center and shortly after passing over the island of grenada the depression intensified into tropical storm felix early at around 0900 utc on september 1 14 felix quickly strengthened as it developed a small inner core of convection with tightly-wound bands around the center 15 and by late on september 1 an eye feature was observed on satellite imagery 16 based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft the national hurricane center estimated that felix attained hurricane status by early on september 2 while located about 155 mi 250 km east-northeast of bonaire 17 hurricane felix rapidly intensifying south of hispaniola on september 2 tracking through an area of extremely low wind shear and increasingly high oceanic heat content felix quickly developed a well-defined eye a symmetric cloud structure and strong upper-level outflow 18 consequently the hurricane commenced explosive intensification shortly afterward felix attained major hurricane status at around 1800 utc on september 2 while located about 490 mi 790 km southeast of kingston jamaica 19 rapid strengthening continued and later that day the hurricane attained category 4 status on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with the pressure dropping to 957 mbar hpa 28.26 inhg this corresponded to a falling rate of 3.4 mbar hpa 0.1 inhg per hour which the national hurricane center described as one of the more rapid deepening rates we have observed a hurricane hunters flight reported a stadium effect in the eye and also reported the eye diameter shrank to 14 mi 22 km 20 a subsequent hurricane hunters flight experienced flight level winds of 175 mph 280 km h with peak surface winds of 163 mph 263 km h reported in the southwest quadrant of the eyewall surface winds of 189 mph 306 km h were found in its northeastern quadrant although the national hurricane center reported the peak reading could have been contaminated due to graupel in the clouds based on the observations it is estimated felix attained winds of 175 mph 280 km h by 0000 utc on september 3 while located about 390 mi 625 km southeast of kingston jamaica making felix a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale while investigating the hurricane hurricane hunters encountered extreme turbulence and potentially dangerous graupel which forced the flight to abort the mission 21 continuing quickly westward the diameter of the eye decreased to 12 mi 19 km 22 and the national hurricane center estimates the hurricane attained a minimum central pressure of 929 mbar hpa 27.43 inhg about seven hours after it reached category 5 status 4 initially felix was predicted to track west-northwestward striking belize before crossing the yucatán peninsula 22 however its path remained nearly due westward subsequently cloud tops near the center started to warm as the eye became less distinct 23 and by 1800 utc on september 3 felix weakened to category 4 status with winds of 145 mph 235 km h 24 on september 4 felix had completed an eyewall replacement cycle and began strengthening again during the day 25 felix was upgraded to a category 5 for the second time at 1040 utc 26 and made landfall in extreme north-eastern nicaragua shortly thereafter with winds of 160 mph 260 km h 27 by nine hours after moving ashore the system maintained a well-organized cloud pattern and intense rainbands although the winds rapidly decreased 28 early on september 5 felix weakened to a tropical storm as its upper-level circulation became detached from the low-level portion 29 the system deteriorated to a tropical depression as it crossed into southern honduras and at 0900 utc the national hurricane center issued the last advisory on felix as it began degenerating into a broad low pressure area 30 the remnants of felix tracked west-northwestward over other portions of latin america and eventually dissipated over the mexican state of tabasco on september 7 4 preparations edit hurricane felix in the western caribbean sea nearing central america on september 3 upon felix s becoming a tropical cyclone a tropical storm warning was issued for saint vincent and the grenadines tobago and grenada and its dependencies a tropical storm watch was also issued for the northeastern venezuela

nicaragua issued a hurricane warning from puerto cabezas northward to the national border 45 about 12 hours before landfall a tropical storm warning was issued from puerto cabezas southward to prinzapolka 41 prior to the arrival of the hurricane officials sent about 140,000 lbs 63,000 kg of meals and emergency supplies to near the landfall location 46 impact edit caribbean islands edit felix passing aruba at around 1200 utc on september 1 a wind gust of 46 mph 74 km h was recorded on barbados and around the same time a gust of 44 mph 71 km h was observed in saint vincent 47 the storm produced heavy rainfall across the windward islands on trinidad heavy precipitation caused mudslides and overflown rivers which destroyed some bridges moderate winds damaged several buildings on

40,000 2007 usd 46.2 thousand 2017 usd 49 felix produced gusty winds on grenada which downed several power lines and destroyed the roofs of two houses rough waves also broke several vessels from their anchors 35 in st lucia winds from the storm damaged the roof of a store in castries which collapsed and destroyed 12 vehicles 48 in the abc islands the hurricane resulted in gusty winds and heavy rainfall however little damage was reported in bonaire the precipitation left several homes submerged under water in curaçao in aruba the winds damaged one house and briefly left a northern town

nicaragua declared the northern caribbean coast a disaster area 51 the miskito cays located about 43 mi 69 km from bilwi on the northeast coast of nicaragua was among the strongest hit areas hurricane felix had not yet made landfall but reached maximum force when it passed over the miskito cays the winds of the hurricane with speeds of up to 160 mph 260 km h destroyed the cays completely pillars that previously formed the base of the houses were the only remains on the cays 52 at least 133 people were reported dead at least 130 of them were in nicaragua 53 while few details have been
