rico dominican republic haiti turks and caicos islands the bahamas southeastern united states mid-atlantic states ireland united kingdom france spain part of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season hurricane maria was the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record the worst natural disaster in dominica in its recorded history and the strongest hurricane to make landfall in puerto rico since 1928 the thirteenth named storm seventh hurricane fourth major hurricane and the second category 5 hurricane of the unusually active 2017 atlantic hurricane season maria caused catastrophic damage during its journey across the northeastern caribbean as the second most intense landfall and the costliest hurricane ever to hit the region it was the third major hurricane in a row to threaten the leeward islands with a direct strike or major impacts within two weeks after hurricane irma caused catastrophic damage there and jose then a category 4 hurricane passed dangerously close just days after originating from a tropical wave that the national hurricane center began monitoring on september 13 maria developed into a tropical storm on september 16 east of the lesser antilles with steady strengthening occurring in remarkably favorable conditions for further development on september 18 maria underwent explosive intensification doubling its sustained wind speed from 80 mph 130 km h to 160 mph 260 km h becoming a category 5 hurricane making the 2017 season the first since 2007 to feature two category 5 hurricanes and one of only six atlantic hurricane seasons to feature two or more category 5 hurricanes in the satellite era when maria made landfall at this strength on dominica on the following day it became the first category 5 hurricane to strike dominica and made 2017 the second season after 2007 to feature two hurricanes making landfall at category 5 intensity after briefly weakening to category 4 status maria reintensified to attain peak winds of 175 mph 280 km h and a minimum central pressure of 908 mbar hpa 26.85 inhg becoming the tenth most intense atlantic hurricane on record for 2017 this central pressure is the lowest worldwide thus far succeeding peak intensity an eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to a high-end category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph 250 km h before making landfall in puerto rico making maria the strongest to hit the territory since the 1928 san felipe hurricane maria had the lowest central pressure of any hurricane to make landfall in the united states including locations outside of the lower 48 since hurricane camille in 1969 and the lowest pressure ever recorded in puerto rico as of october 1 the hurricane has caused at least 78 deaths 30 in dominica 5 in the dominican republic 2 in guadeloupe 3 in haiti 34 in puerto rico 1 in the united states virgin islands and 3 in the contiguous united states initial assessments indicate catastrophic damage to dominica which suffered an island-wide communication blackout the islands of guadeloupe and martinique also endured widespread flooding damaged roofs and uprooted trees puerto rico has suffered catastrophic damage including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid total losses from the hurricane are estimated at around 91 billion 2017 usd mostly in puerto rico making maria s cost comparable to that of previous hurricanes irma and harvey 1 2 meteorological history edit map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffir–simpson scale the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring two tropical waves on september 13 3 the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become hurricane lee while the western one continued moving generally west with generally favorable conditions in the disturbance s path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely 4 during those two days the disturbance became better organized 5 and by september 16 convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the nhc initiated advisories on it as potential tropical cyclone fifteen at 15 00 utc in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season 6 7 a mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development sea surface temperatures of 84 °f 29 °c low wind shear and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the lesser antilles 6 8 as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm – based on satellite estimates – at 21 00 utc that day receiving the name maria 9 at this time maria was situated 620 mi 1,000 km east-southeast of the lesser antilles 10 most intense atlantic hurricanes rank hurricane season pressure hpa inhg 1

morning hours of september 17 8 after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation 12 a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed hurricane hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74 mph 119 km h and a formative eye feature accordingly the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 21 00 utc 13 expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of september 17–18 14 considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricane s core early on september 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification 15 explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120 mph 195 km h and a central pressure of 959 mbar hpa 28.32 inhg making maria a category 3 hurricane on the saffir–simpson scale and hence a major hurricane additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12 mi 19 km wide eye 16 the eye contracted slightly to 9 mi 14 km as intensification continued and the system reached category 4 strength by 21 00 utc 17 radar imagery of hurricane maria from puerto rico at 09 36 utc 5 36 a.m local time shortly before it stopped transmitting data rapid intensification culminated late on september 18 with maria achieving category 5 status just 15 mi 25 km east-southeast of dominica 18 hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160 mph 260 km h and a pressure of 925 mbar hpa 27.32 inhg at this time 19 maria made landfall in dominica at 01 15 utc on september 19 20 becoming the first category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation 21 interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to category 4 however once over the caribbean sea maria regained category 5 intensity 22 23 additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward puerto rico despite the formation of concentric eyewalls—the larger one spanning 25 to 35 mi 40 to 56 km and the smaller only 5 mi 8.0 km signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle—the inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon 24 maria attained its peak intensity around 04 00 utc on september 20 roughly 30 mi 45 km south of st croix sustained winds reached 175 mph 280 km h and its central pressure bottomed out at 908 mbar hpa 26.85 inhg this ranks it as the tenth-strongest atlantic hurricane since reliable records began 25 26 27 infrared loop of hurricane maria passing st. croix vieques and landfalling on puerto rico on the morning of september 20 the hurricane made its closest approach to st croix around 05 00 utc on september 20 passing within 20 mi 30 km of the island the storm s outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore 28 hours later around 08 00 utc the outer eyewall struck vieques an island off the eastern coast of puerto rico 29 by this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to category 4 strength 30 maria made landfall just south of yabucoa puerto rico around 10 15 utc with sustained winds of 155 mph 250 km h 31 making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 san felipe segundo hurricane 32 maria maintained a general west-northwest course across puerto rico emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 18 00 utc interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening sustained winds fell to 110 mph 175 km h and the central pressure rose to 957 mbars hpa 28.26 inhg 33 with favorable environmental conditions maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico a large eye 45 mi 75 km wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it early on september 21 the system regained category 3 intensity 34 initially cooler waters stirred up by hurricane irma two weeks prior limited maria s reorganization 35 during the afternoon of september 21 the system traversed the navidad and silver banks north of the dominican republic shoaling from the region s shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds 36 convection around the storm s eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125 mph 205 km h 37 an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall 38 39 late on september 22 the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest 40 maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23 with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled it maintained category 3 hurricane strength during this phase 41 42 despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to category 2 strength early on september 24 hurricane hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135 mph 187 to 217 km h however surface wind returns by the noaa s stepped-frequency microwave radiometer were only 90 mph 150 km h this indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft 43 44 by this time maria s trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low over the eastern gulf of mexico 44 weakening accelerated later on september 24 into september 25 as the hurricane traversed a cold wake—with sea surface temperatures of 75–77 °f 24–25 °c —created by hurricane jose a week prior maria degraded to category 1 strength during this time 45 early on september 25 maria s structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed the low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm 46 maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september 26 47 however a sustained convective burst resulted in maria s winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on september 27 48 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation 49 despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28 simultaneously maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies 50 gradually weakening maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73 °f 23 °c and below causing most of its convection to dissipate late on september 30 maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 51 during the next couple of days maria s remnant accelerated towards the united kingdom while rapidly weakening 52 53 maria s remnants later crossed the iberian peninsula into the western mediterranean sea before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same day 54 preparations edit this

15 ast that day 1 15 utc september 19 as a category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph 260 km h 20 these winds the most extreme to ever impact the island 96 battered the roof of practically every home—including the official residence of prime minister roosevelt skerrit who required rescue when his home began to flood 97 downing all cellular radio and internet services maria effectively cut dominica off from the outside world the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricane s passage 98 99 skerrit called the devastation mind boggling before going offline and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage 98 initial ham radio reports from the capital of roseau on september 19 indicated total devastation with half the city flooded cars stranded and stretches of residential area flattened 100 the next morning the first aerial footage of dominica elucidated the scope of the destruction 101 maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural remnants 101 102 the hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings such as schools stores and churches 102 and affected all of dominica s 73,000 residents in some form or way 103 the air control towers and terminal buildings of the canefield and douglas charles airports were severely damaged although the runways remained relatively intact and open to

area is littered with structural debris damaged vegetation and downed power poles and lines the infrastructure of roseau was left in ruins practically every power pole and line was downed and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt the winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the baptist church 105 to the south of roseau riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of pointe michel destroying about 80 of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the country 106 107 outside the capital area the worst of

damaged 108 settlements in saint david parish such as castle bruce good hope and grand fond had been practically eradicated many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations in rosalie rushing waters gushed over the village s bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area throughout saint patrick parish the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation buildings in grand bay the parish s main settlement experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised many houses in la plaine caved in or slid into rivers and its single bridge was broken 109 overall the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98 of the island s buildings 103 including those serving as shelters 101 half of the houses had their frames destroyed 103 its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the island s lush rainforests 110 the agricultural sector a vital source of income for the country was completely wiped out 100 of banana and tuber plantations was lost as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm equipment 103 in maria s wake dominica s population suffered from an island-wide water shortage due to uprooted pipes the caribbean disaster emergency management agency cdema estimates that the hurricane has caused billions of dollars worth of damage 111 as of october 1 there are

gourbeyre observed a peak wind speed of 101 mph 162 km h while winds up north in nearby baillif reached 92 mph 148 km h 114 along those regions the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20 ft 6 m waves 115 the combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago especially from pointe-à-pitre along grand-terre island s southwestern coast to petit-bourg and the southern coasts on basse-terre island 69 aside from wind-related effects rainfall from maria was also significant in just a day the hurricane dropped nearly a month s worth of rainfall at some important locations pointe-à-pitre recorded a 24-hour total of 7.5 inches 191 mm while the capital of basse-terre measured 6.4 in 163 mm 89 even greater quantities fell at higher elevations of basse terre island with a maximum total of 18.07 in 459 mm measured at the mountainous locality of matouba saint-claude 114 throughout the archipelago the hurricane left 40 of the population 80,000 households without power and 25 of landline users without service 116 the islands of marie-galante la désirade and especially les saintes bore the brunt of the winds which caused heavy damage to structures and nature alike and cut the islands off from their surroundings for several days 69 116 homes on terre-de-haut island of les saintes were flooded or lost their roofs
