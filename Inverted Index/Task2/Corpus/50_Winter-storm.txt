event in which varieties of precipitation are formed that only occur at low temperatures such as snow or sleet or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow ice to form i.e freezing rain in temperate continental climates these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well very rarely they may form in summer though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer such as the summer of 1816 in the northeast united states of america snow edit main article snow chicago s fullerton harbor looking south during the january 31 – february 2 2011 north american winter storm left and on a clear day for comparison approaching winter storm in salt lake city snowstorms are storms where large amounts of snow fall two inches 5 cm of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to traffic and school transport because of the difficulty to drive and maneuver the school buses on slick roads this is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur in places where snowfall is typical such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities increased use of four-wheel drive and snow tires and drivers being more used to winter conditions snowfalls in excess of 6 inches 15 cm are usually universally disruptive a massive snowstorm with strong winds and other conditions meeting certain criteria is known as a blizzard a large number of heavy snowstorms some of which were blizzards occurred in the united states during 1888 and 1947 as well as the early and mid-1990s the snowfall of 1947 exceeded 2 feet 61 cm with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached 12 feet 3.7 m and for months temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow the 1993 superstorm manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas large snowstorms could be quite dangerous a 6 in 15 cm snowstorm will make some unplowed roads impassable and it is possible for automobiles to get stuck in the snow snowstorms exceeding 12 in 30 cm especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the roofs of some homes and cause the loss of electricity standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow especially if it is wet or very dense even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions dangers of snow edit this article may need to be rewritten entirely to comply with wikipedia s quality standards as section you can help the discussion page may

produce cornices and avalanches an additional danger following a snowy winter is spring flooding if the snow melts suddenly because of a dramatic rise in air temperature deaths can occur from hypothermia infections brought on by frostbite or car accidents due to slippery roads fires and carbon monoxide poisoning can occur after a storm causes a power outage large amounts of snow can also significantly reduce visibility in the area a phenomenon known as a whiteout this can be very dangerous to those who are in densely populated areas since the whiteout can cause major accidents on the road or while flying there are also several cases of heart attacks caused by overexertion while shoveling heavy wet snow it is difficult to predict what form this precipitation will take and it may alternate between rain and snow therefore weather forecasters just predict a wintry mix usually this type of precipitation occurs at temperatures between −2 and 2 °c 28.4 and 35.6 °f in commonwealth countries a mixture of rain and snow is usually referred to as sleet snowstorms generally occur when different types of air masses in the mid-latitudes interact these storms feed on differences in temperature and moisture initially a wave is typically formed in the mid levels of the atmosphere as a result of a variety of things be it a mountain range injection of vorticity energy or several other reasons assuming certain conditions are in place for this wave to amplify it will do so and begin to rotate which effectively moves warm and moist air from one air mass to the north and much colder and drier air behind it to the south and east the boundaries between the air masses constitute the warm and cold fronts of the new cyclone storm snowstorms that produce a lot of snow require an outside source of moisture such as the gulf of mexico or the atlantic ocean in the united states this requires yet more conditions to be just right namely for the flow the general wind flow at certain levels of the atmosphere in the low-mid levels of the atmosphere to be aligned such that moisture can readily be transported from these regions directly into the storm another condition that must be met for a healthy storm is the air that is converging and rising in the center of this low pressure system the snowstorm to have an outlet as it rises up in the atmosphere in other words this air must be able to readily diverge at the mid levels of the atmosphere effectively removing it from the storm and allowing this cycle to continue freezing rain edit main articles ice storm and freezing rain ice storms often coat many surfaces such as trees  coated in ice power and telephone lines sag and often break resulting in power outages.  plants wrapped in 6 mm 0.24 in of ice severe ice storms which may occur in the spring can kill plant life.  crabapple covered in icy glaze due to freezing rain.  heavy showers of freezing rain are one of the most dangerous types of winter storm they typically occur when a layer of warm air hovers over a region but the ambient temperature a few meters above the ground is near or below 0 °c 32 °f and the ground temperature is sub-freezing while a 10 cm 3.9 in snowstorm is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern united states and canada a comparable 10 mm 0.39 in ice storm can paralyze a region driving becomes extremely hazardous telephone and power lines are damaged and crops may be ruined 1 notable ice storms include an el niño-related north american ice storm of 1998 that affected much of eastern canada including montreal and ottawa as well as upstate new york and part of new england three million people lost power some for as long as six weeks one-third of the trees in montreal s mount royal park were damaged as well as a large proportion of the sugar-producing maple trees the amount of economic damage caused by the storm has been estimated at 3 billion canadian the christmas day ice storm of 2000 caused devastating electrical issues in parts of arkansas oklahoma and texas the city of texarkana arkansas experienced the worst damage at one point losing the ability to use telephones power and running water in some areas in arkansas oklahoma texas and eventually louisiana over an inch of ice accumulated from the freezing rain 2 3 the ice storm of december 2002 in north carolina resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state and property damage due to falling trees except in the mountainous western part of the state heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in north carolina the ice storm of december 2005 was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the southern united states on december 14 to 16 it led to power outages and at least 7 deaths in january 2005 kansas had been declared a major disaster zone by president george w bush after an ice storm caused nearly 39 million in damages to thirty-two counties federal funds were provided to the counties during january 4–6 2005 to aid the recovery process 4 the january 2009 central plains and midwest ice storm was a crippling and historic ice storm most places struck by the storm saw 2 inches 51 mm or more of ice accumulation and a few inches of snow on top of it this brought down power lines causing some people to go without power for a few days to a few weeks in some cases some didn t see power for a month or more at the height of the storm more than 2 million people were without power graupel edit main article graupel ice crystals fall through a cloud of super-cooled droplets—minute cloud droplets that have fallen below freezing temperature but have not frozen the ice crystal plows into the super-cooled droplets and they immediately freeze to it this process forms graupel or snow pellets as the droplet continues to accumulate on the crystal the pellets bounce when they hit the ground ice pellets edit main article ice pellets out ahead of the passage of a warm front falling snow may partially melt and refreeze into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground these ice pellets are called sleet in most of the us because it is easily seen and does not accumulate ice it is not as dangerous as freezing rain rime edit main article hard rime see also soft rime rime is a milky white accumulation of super-cooled cloud or fog droplets that freeze when they strike an object that has a temperature of 32 °f 0 °c the freezing point of water the process is called riming when super-cooled cloud droplets attach to ice crystals in the formation of graupel rime ice can pose a hazard to an airliner when it forms on a wing as an aircraft flies through a cloud of super-cooled droplets
