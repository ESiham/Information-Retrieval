Link Analysis and PageRank Implementation - Assignment 2 - Information Retrieval - CS 6200
==========================================================================================

The goal of this assignment is Link Analysis and PageRank Implementation.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. The program is written in Python 2.7, so we need to install Python 2.7 locally to be able to run it.
2. Download Python 2.7 from https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
3. We need to setup the environment variables so that we can run the ".py" file with "python" command.
4. The program uses BeautifulSoup4 for downloading HTML files from the internet, we can install it by:
   pip install beautifulsoup4
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RUNNING THE PROGRAM:

1. Running the program involves traversing to the directory where the ".py" program file is located.
2. Start the Page-Rank implementation by typing the command "python <file_name>.py" in the command line/Terminal.

Files:

Task 1:

A. Source Code for generating graph, Web Crawler using Breadth First Traversal and Web Crawler using Depth First Traversal
   in Task1 > src
B. URL List generated by Running crawler in Depth First and Breadth First Mode in Task1 > src
C. "graph-1.txt", the file that contains the directed graph for crawler implemented using Breadth First Traversal
D. "graph-2.txt", the file that contains the directed graph for crawler implemented using Depth First Traversal
E. Statistics about Graph-1 and Graph-2 can be found in "Analysis.txt" file

Task 2:

B. Input graph for crawler implemented using Breadth First Traversal "graph-1.txt"
C. Input graph for crawler implemented using Depth First Traversal "graph-2.txt"
D. Top 50 Pages report by Doc_ID and Page Rank scores for "graph-1" in "G1-Top50.txt"
E. Top 50 Pages report by Doc_ID and Page Rank scores for "graph-2" in "G2-Top50.txt"
F. Perplexity Values obtained in each round till convergence for "graph-1" in "G1-Perplexity.txt"
G. Perplexity Values obtained in each round till convergence for "graph-2" in "G2-Perplexity.txt"
H. For The Trial small graph given, its Page-Rank scores and perplexity value is in "Trial-PR" folder

Task 3:

A. "Analysis.txt" file which explains and speculates the result obtained.
